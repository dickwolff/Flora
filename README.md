# Flora
Manage all your plants in one app, get notified when they need water and share watering duties with others in your home.

## About Flora
Flora was the Roman goddess of flowers and of the spring season â€“ a symbol for nature and flowers [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flora_(mythology)).

## The app
Flora is published as a Docker container. This contains both the server side, and the (web) app. When you open the app you can configure wether you want to join an existing home, or create a new one.
